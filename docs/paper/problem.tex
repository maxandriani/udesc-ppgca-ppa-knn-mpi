\section*{Problem definition}

Given a set of two-dimensional points $S$ divided intro $n$ groups, an integer $k$ and a two-dimensional point $P$ to be classified, the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm can be used to solve the classification problem of the point $P$, i.e., classifying the point $P$ into one of the $n$ existing groups based on some criteria.

The KNN algorithm works by comparing the distances from each point $s \in S$ to the point $P$, then selecting the $k$ points with the smallest distance values and counting the frequency of each group in these $k$ points, the point $P$ is then classified to belong to the group with the highest frequency among the $k$ nearest points.

The Figure \ref{example} illustrates an example of the KNN classification algorithm being applied. The points have been segregated between 4 different groups (\textit{i.e.}, A, B, C and D) and a point $P$ with no group is provided to be classified, the KNN algorithm then searches for the $k$ points closest to the point $P$ and, after that, the groups have their frequencies counted, with the highest frequency being chosen as the classification of $P$, in the case of this example, the point $P$ is classified to belong to the group C.

\section*{Input}

An input represents the classification of a single point. The first line contains the pattern "n\_groups=$n$", where $n$ is the total number of groups in this input. Then, for each of the $n$ groups the following lines will be provided, the first line has the pattern "label=$c$" where $c$ is a single character that represents the label (\textit{i.e.}, identification) of the group, then the second line follows the pattern "length=$L$", where $L$ is the number of two-dimensional points in this group and then, the next $L$ lines contain the pattern "($x$,$y$)" that represents each point that belongs to the aforementioned group. After all groups have been represented there's a single line with the pattern "k=$k$", where $k$ is the parameter previously discussed. Lastly, the final line also contains the pattern "($x$,$y$)", representing the coordinates to the two-dimensional point to be classified.

\textit{The input must be read form the standard input.}

\section*{Output}

The output contains a single character, it being the label of the group chosen as the classification of the provided point.

\textit{The output must be written to the standard output.}
